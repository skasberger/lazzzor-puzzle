Lazzzor Puzzle
==============================

This is a tiny script to automatically convert shapfiles to SVG and PDF files for se with a Laser cutter. The script uses [Kartograph.py](http://kartograph.org/docs/kartograph.py/) for this.

## Documentation
### Function
#### Preparations
First, the script copies all three necessary files of the shapefile () to get processed afterwards by kartograph.py. The files will be copied to a folder called after the shapefile. In there will be created a json-file

#### Kartograph.py
Kartograph.py needs a config in form of a json-file, which will be created and named after the shapefile. After this Kartograph.py converts the shape-file into an svg-file.

#### Convert 2 PDF
At the end, the script converts the svg-file into a pdf.

All files are named after the shapefiles filenames and will be stored in puzzles/ in a subfolder called as the shapefile.

### Install
Before to start, you have to install Kartograph.py on your pc. Find out more about this at the [documentation](http://kartograph.org/docs/kartograph.py/).

### Execute
To convert a shape file:
- check, if you have all 3 necessary shapfiles (*.shp, *.shx, *.dbf)
- change your directory to the root directory of the repo (where the shape2images.sh file is)
- execute the shell-script: pass the shapefile as argument. Optional you also can pass the new folder name.

```shell
sh shape2images.sh FOLDER/FILENAME.shp
```
This will store the files in the folder puzzles/FILENAME/

You also can pass a folder as second argument, to specify the place, where the files will be stored:
```shell
sh shape2images.sh FOLDER/FILENAME.shp NEWFOLDER/
```
This will store the files in the folder puzzles/NEWFOLDER/

The project was an idea of [Michael Bauer](https://twitter.com/mihi_tr) and realized together wit Stefan Kasberger during the Open Week Graz Ausw√§rtsspiel at the [Metalab](https://metalab.at/) on their [Lazzzor](http://lazzzor.soup.io/) in Vienna.

## Participate
If you made some new vector files, it would be amazing to share your files with others and merge it with this repo.

**Pleas don't forget to add a LICENSE text for the shape files inside the folders!**

You also can add some functions to the script or add a documentation how to use the lazzzer cutter, which material can be used or what other things can be made out of this.
